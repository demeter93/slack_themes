Slack Themes

Who doesn't love Slack? It's pretty much perfect. But if you stare at it for approximately 25 hours a day, sometimes it's nice to add a little variety.

This repo is a collection of sidebar themes. To use them:

1. Select the main menu dropdown by clicking your profile pic.
2. Select "Preferences".
3. Select "Sidebar Theme".
4. Copy and paste the hex values from your desired configuration into the large text box at the bottom of the Custom Theme section.
5. Select "Done".
